## üîß Configuration

### Customizing Your App

Edit `capacitor.config.ts` to customize your app:

```typescript
const config: CapacitorConfig = {
  appId: 'com.yourcompany.yourapp',  // Change this to your app ID
  appName: 'Your App Name',          // Change this to your app name
  webDir: 'dist',
  server: {
    androidScheme: 'https'
  }
};
```

### App Icon and Splash Screen

**Note**: Since we're using GitHub Actions, you'll need to:
1. Replace icon files in your repository
2. Push changes to trigger automatic rebuild
3. Download the new APK from Actions/Releases

## ü§ñ GitHub Actions Workflow

This repository uses **GitHub Actions for automated APK building** - no local setup needed!

### üöÄ How It Works
1. **Push your code** to GitHub
2. **GitHub Actions** automatically:
   - Sets up Android SDK and Java
   - Installs Node.js dependencies
   - Builds your APK using Capacitor
   - Creates a release with download link
3. **Download your APK** from Actions tab or Releases page

### üì± Build Triggers
- **Push to main**: Builds debug APK + creates release
- **Version tags** (v1.0.0): Builds signed release APK
- **Pull requests**: Tests setup without building APK
- **Manual**: Use "Actions" tab to trigger builds on-demand

### üì• APK Downloads
- **Actions Tab**: Download APK artifacts (30-day retention)
- **Releases Page**: Automatic releases with APK attachments
- **Direct Links**: APK files attached to every release

## üì± Installing Your APK

### **Step 1: Download APK**
- Go to your repository's **Actions** tab
- Click on the latest workflow run
- Download the `app-debug-apk` artifact
- Or check the **Releases** page for automatic releases

### **Step 2: Install on Android**
1. **Enable Unknown Sources**:
   - Go to Settings > Security > Unknown Sources
   - Enable "Install from unknown sources"

2. **Install the APK**:
   - Transfer APK to your Android device
   - Tap on it to install
   - Follow the installation prompts

## üé® Example Website

This repository includes a beautiful example website that demonstrates:
- Modern CSS with gradients and animations
- Responsive design

- Mobile-optimized layout

Replace the example files with your own website to get started!

## üîç Troubleshooting

### **GitHub Actions Issues:**

**"Workflow failed"**
- Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs
- Ensure your `index.html` file exists in the root directory
- Verify all required files are committed to Git

**"APK not found in artifacts"**
- Wait for the workflow to complete (usually 5-10 minutes)
- Check the Actions tab for the latest successful run
- Download from the "Artifacts" section

**"Build timeout"**
- GitHub Actions has a 6-hour limit
- Most builds complete in 5-15 minutes
- If it times out, try pushing again

### **Getting Help:**
1. Check the [Issues](https://github.com/AshishY794/web2appA/issues) page
2. Create a new issue with your error details
3. Include the workflow run link and error logs

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### **Creating Release Versions**

To build signed release APKs:

1. **Create a version tag:**
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

2. **GitHub Actions automatically:**
   - Builds a signed release APK
   - Creates a GitHub release
   - Attaches the APK for download

### **Customizing Workflows**

You can modify the GitHub Actions workflows:
- `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml` - Debug APK builds
- `.github/workflows/build-release.yml` - Release APK builds
- `.github/workflows/test-setup.yml` - Setup testing
